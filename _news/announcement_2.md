**Effect of Streamflow Measurement Error on Flood Frequency Estimation**

Significant errors often arise when measuring streamflow during high flows and flood events. Such errors conflated by short records of observations may induce bias in the flood frequency estimates, leading to costly engineering design mistakes. This work illustrates how observational (measurement) errors affect the uncertainty of flood frequency estimation. The study used the Bulletin 17C (US standard) method to estimate flood frequencies of historical peak flows modified to represent the measurement limitations. To perform the modifications, the authors explored, via Monte Carlo simulation, four hypothetical scenarios that mimic measurement errors, sample size limitations, and their combination. They used a multiplicative noise from a log-normal distribution to simulate the measurement errors. They implemented a bootstrap approach to represent the sampling error. They randomly selected M samples from the total N records of the observed peak flows of four gauging stations in Iowa in central USA. The observed data record ranges between 76 and 119 years for watersheds with drainage areas between 500 and 16,000 km2. According to the results, measurement errors lead to more significant differences than sampling limitations. The scenarios exhibited differences with median magnitudes of up to 50%, with some cases reaching differences up to 100% for return periods above 50 years. The results raise a red flag regarding flood frequency estimation that warrants looking for further research around observational errors.
