**Exploring the link between flash floods, geomorpholoy, and rainfall in the Colombian Andes**

The Andean mountanious rage in Colombia (my home country) is highly succeptible to flash floods. The occurrence of flash floods has taken a toll of about XX lives with costs of up to XX in the last XX years. Despite their impact, we still don't understand where and when they can happen and we are only certain that intense rainfall events detonate [them](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/1367/2020/). Besides that, we have litte information regarding the features of the watersheds that can exhibit these events. In this work, **Laura** used [watershed oriented computational tools](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/10/4/76) along with [radar rainfall analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/9/7/119) to explore the connection between watershed features and intense events. According to her results, we can identify flash flood prone watersheds using some geomorphological and rainfall parameters.    

This work is the result of the Master [thesis](https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/85269) developed by **Laura Garcia** and directed by myself along with the Professor **Luis Fernando Carvajal** from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. You can also fing a [note]() about this work made by the **Facultad de Minas**.
