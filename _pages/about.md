I have been an Assistant Researcher at the Iowa Flood Center since 2018. I am part of the development and evaluation team in charge of the hydrological model. I developed and implemented various modules to represent subsurface artificial drainage, snow processes, and the development of parameterization methodologies. Before working at the IFC, I served as the leader of the Hydrology group in the Environmental Alert System of the Aburrá Valley. During this period, I worked on my doctoral thesis and I was a guest lecturer at different universities in Medellín, Colombia (my home town). Additionally, I have experience as an independent consultant, working on hydrology projects in different regions of the country.
