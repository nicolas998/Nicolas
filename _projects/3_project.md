Between 2011 and 2018 I worked at SIATA developing the flood forecast system for the Aburra Valley Watershed. During this time I developed the Watershed Modeling Framework ([WMF](https://github.com/nicolas998/WMF)) a system that supported the distributed hydrological used to forecast floods. I also managed the hydrological team in charge of performing water quality and quantity monitoring, devloping a fire hazzards model, and a landslide model.
